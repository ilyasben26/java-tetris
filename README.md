A tetris clone made in Java by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgVh6S8X25k&list=PL8wKnrrMApCoP9xTwOmQRHsZ8_Kr9c_DY). 

## Getting Started:
1. Make sure you have Java 17 or later using `java --version`
2. Download the `Tetris.jar` file from the release
3. Run `java -jar Tetris.jar`

  - Overriding
  - ...
- Using the Apache NetBeans IDE to create desktop applications

## Game Features:
- Leaderboard
